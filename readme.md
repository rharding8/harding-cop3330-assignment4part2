To-Do Lister
-
By Ryan Harding

Introduction
-
To-Do Lister is an app with no filler.
Return to a time when apps did exactly what you wanted
how you wanted them to. Nothing more and nothing less.
That minimalism has been lost in modern design,
but To-Do Lister seeks to embrace that old-school
feel.

The Basics
-
To-Do Lister is an interface for creating and managing
To-Do Lists and is able to store up to 100 unique items.

Every item has a simple make-up. A reasonable-length
description, a date with a YYYY-MM-DD format, and
a selected completion.

Every operation in To-Do Lister is designed for simplicty.
All that has to be done is entering text and clicking buttons.
No complicated menu systems or forcing you to navigate across
several different screens.

Managing a List
-
Adding an item is as simple as entering your desired description and date
into corresponding fields and clicking "Add Item". If the item is already completed, you may
also check the completion checkbox to set that status.

To remove an item, just select the item from the list and click
"Remove Item".

To set the title of the list, enter the title you want into the
corresponding field and click "Set Title".

Editing Items
-
To edit an item, simply select it from the list, enter the new information 
into the right fields, and click "Update Item".

Just as a note, doing so by default will leave the item marked incomplete.
To preserve a completed status, make sure to check the complete
checkbox again before clicking "Update Item".

Sorting Items
-
Clicking "Sort By Date" will sort the list from earliest
item to latest item. This sort is irreversable, so if a custom order
is required it is best to avoid the button.

Clicking "Show Completed Items" will filter the list to only show
items marked complete. Clicking "Show Incompleted Items" will do the same
for items not marked complete.

To show the full list again, click "Show All Items" and the list will refresh.

Saving and Loading Lists
-
To Save a To-Do List as a file (JSon is the accepted),
enter the path you wish to save to in the field marked for such
and click "Save List". You may enter the path to a JSon File,
or to a folder that the program will create a file in. In
the latter case, the file will be named "[TITLE].json".

To Load a To-Do List from a JSon file, enter a path to a JSon file
in the path field, and click "Load List". By default the title of the list is assumed
as the file name.

Note: Saving a file where there is already a file with the same name will
overwrite the existing file, and Loading a list from a file will overwrite the list
in memory. Because of this, it is best to be cautious when saving and loading.

Invalid Input
-
If the information entered into any field is invalid,
that field will update to show an error message. By
using the field to display errors, To-Do Lister eliminates
the dreaded over-use of pop-up windows.

Acknowledgements
-
Thanks go out to Team Ico for their art and themes of
minimalism inspiring the philosophy that drives my design.
To Ice Nine Kills for composing the music that help to focus
my mind on such projects.
To Rey for suggesting readmes to aid the end user.
And to you, the reader, for your interest in the project.

And thanks do not go to the over-simplified logos
that have given minimalism a bad name.

Sincerely,
Ryan Harding
